    <h3>Loopy Model Explanation</h3>

    <h3>Explantion of story board</h3>
    <p>This story board shows how the scenes of our video was planned out. It shows how the grandma was being abusize and truamatizing the daughter while she has a liltle kid in her arms. After these scenes we added others where the daughter is older now and she does the same thing that her mother did to her. This shows the cycle of abusiveness that happens when parents traumatizes their children at a young age.</p>

    <h3>Explanation of Characters</h3>
    <p>The character with the gray hair is the grandma and the on with brown hair and yellow shirt is the daughter. After the first few scenes the daughter then becomes the grandma and the baby becomes grown and is the one with the white shirt and black hair. You can see that we use props like the table, sofa, and the cats. The scenery was inside of a house and in the video you can see the background and props. </p>

    <h3> Code Explanation</h3>
    <p> This code allows me to change the light brightness from 100 to 70 to 50 and to 30. I can use the touch sensors to change the brightness to my liking. The threshold is set to 700 so that it works with the battery only but if i need to plug it into the computer the i can use a switch to change the threshold to 800 so it works with battery and the cable. </p>
